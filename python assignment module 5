# 1.  Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django? 


#     Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. 
#     Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your 
#     app without needing to reinvent the wheel.
    
    
#     open new terminal in command prompt (cmd)

#     1---Create a Environment
#     python -m venv environementname
#     python -m venv myenv

#     2----Activate your environementname
#     environementname\Scripts\activate 
#     myenv\Scripts\activate


#     3----installing Djnago
#     pip install django 

#     4--- craeting project
#     django-admin startproject projectname .
#     django-admin startproject ecommerce .

#     5----creating application
#     django-admin startapp appname
#     django-admin startapp app_crud

#     6--creating datatbase

#     python manage.py makemigrations
#     python manage.py migrate

#     7---running your project
#     python manage.py runserver

#     8--linking app with project
#     goto settings.py file inside project folder



#     create admin penal

#     (myenv) C:\SweetShop Project>python manage.py createsuperuser
#     Username (leave blank to use 'avani'): admin
#     Email address: 
#     Password: 
#     Password (again):
#     This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.
#     This password is too common.
#     This password is entirely numeric.
#     Bypass password validation and create user anyway? [y/N]: y
#     Superuser created successfully.

#     python manage.py runserver



# 2.  How to check installed version of django? 


#     #...............................................................................................................................
#     Example 1:
#     Open the terminal and write the command in your terminal:
#     python -m django --version

#     #...............................................................................................................................
#     Example 2:
#     Another way to check the version is by using the below command.
#     django-admin --version

#     #...............................................................................................................................
#     Example 3:
#     python manage.py runserver
#     Check the Django Version using IDLE
#     Open your Python IDLE. Write the same line in your IDLE given below

#     import django
#     django.get_version()

#     import django
#     django.VERSION

# 3.  Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for? 

#     django-admin.py make messages:
#     makemessages. Runs over the entire source tree of the current directory and pulls out all strings marked for translation. 
#     It creates (or updates) a message file in the conf/locale (in the Django tree) or locale (for project and application) 
#     directory.



# 4.  What is Django URLs?make program to create django urls 

#     Django runs through each URL pattern, in order, and stops at the first one that matches the requested URL, matching 
#     against path_info . Once one of the URL patterns matches, Django imports and calls the given view, which is a Python 
#     function (or a class-based view).


#     1.  Including other URLConf modules
#         It is a good practice to have a URLConf module for every app in Django. 
#         This module needs to be included in the root URLConf module as follows:


#         from django.contrib import admin
#         from django.urls import path, include

#         urlpatterns = [
#             path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
#             path('', include('books.urls')),
#             ]

#     ->  This tells Django to search for URL patterns in the file books/urls.py.

#         URL patterns

#         Hereâ€™s a sample code for books/urls.py:

#         from django.urls import path
#         from . import views

#         urlpatterns = [
#             path('books/<int:pk>/', views.book_detail),
#             path('books/<str:genre>/', views.books_by_genre),
#             path('books/', views.book_index), 
#         ]

# 5.  What is a QuerySet?Write program to create a new Post object in database: 

#     A QuerySet represents a collection of objects from your database. It can have zero, one or many filters. 
#     Filters narrow down the query results based on the given parameters. In SQL terms, a QuerySet equates to a SELECT 
#     statement, and a filter is a limiting clause such as WHERE or LIMIT .
    
#     from django.db import models
 
#     # Create your models here.
#     class User(models.Model):
#         title = models.CharField(max_length = 200)
#         description = models.TextField()

# 6.  Mention what command line can be used to load data into Django? 

#     Django-admin.py loaddata
#     To load data into Django you have to use the command line Django-admin.py loaddata. The command line will searches the data 
#     and loads the contents of the named fixtures into the database.

# 7.  Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for? 

#     django-admin.py make messages:
#     makemessages. Runs over the entire source tree of the current directory and pulls out all strings marked for translation. 
#     It creates (or updates) a message file in the conf/locale (in the Django tree) or locale (for project and application) 
#     directory.


# 8.  Make Django application to demonstrate following things 
#     o There will 
#       be 2 modules(Admin,Product manager)
#     o Admin can add product name 
#       (ex.Product id and product name) ex. (1, Samsung), (2, Apple)...etc. 
#       Data should store in 

# 9.  Product_mst table with product id as primary key o Admin can add 
#     product subcategory details Like (Product price, product image, 
#     Product model, product Ram) data should store in Product_sub_cat 
#     table o Admin can get product name as foreign key from 
#     product_mst table in product_sub_category_details page Admin can 
#     view, update and delete all registered details of product manager can 
#     search product on search bar and get all details about product
